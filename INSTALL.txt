This is the INSTALL file for the cairo distribution.

This package uses OASIS to generate its build system. See section OASIS for
full information. 

Dependencies
============

In order to compile this package, you will need:
* ocaml for all, doc API
* findlib
* lablgtk2 for library cairo_gtk, executable gtk_demo

Installing
==========

1. Uncompress the source archive and go to the root of the package
2. Run 'ocaml setup.ml -configure'
3. Run 'ocaml setup.ml -build'
4. Run 'ocaml setup.ml -install'

Uninstalling
============

1. Go to the root of the package 
2. Run 'ocaml setup.ml -uninstall'

OASIS
=====

OASIS is a program that generates a setup.ml file using a simple '_oasis'
configuration file. The generated setup only depends on the standard OCaml
installation: no additional library is required.

(* OASIS_STOP *)

Further configuration
=====================

To compile cairo_gtk, you will need the development files for lablgtk
which are present in the Debian package liblablgtk2-ocaml-dev (or
similar for other distributions).  If you do not want that module, use
the flag --disable-lablgtk2 at the configure step.

The file 'config.ml' allows to set your own flags for the C libraries
Cairo and Gtk+, bypassing pkg-config detection during configure.

Windows
=======

To install Cairo, we recommend that you download GTK+ for windows [1]
and install it in C:/gtk (you can install it in any other directory
whose path contains NO space but you will have to specify them with
--with-cairo-lib and --with-cairo-inc) and put C:\gtk\bin in your PATH
environment variable.  To use Cairo with GTK+, please also install
lablgtk2 [2].
