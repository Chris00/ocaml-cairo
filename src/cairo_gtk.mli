(** Integration of Cairo with labgtk2 (if the later is available).

    It allows to create Cairo contexts which can be used to draw on
    GDK drawables. Additional functions allow to convert GDK's
    rectangles and regions into Cairo paths and to use pixbufs as
    sources for drawing operations.  *)

val create : [> `drawable] Gobject.obj -> Cairo.context
  (** [create drawable] creates a Cairo context for drawing to
      [drawable].

      NOTE: due to double-buffering, Cairo contexts created in a GTK+
      expose event handler cannot be cached and reused between
      different expose events.  *)

val set_source_color : Cairo.context -> Gdk.color -> unit
  (** [set_source_color cr color] sets the specified [color] as the
      source color of cr. *)

val rectangle : Cairo.context -> Gdk.Rectangle.t -> unit
  (** [rectangle cr r] adds the rectangle [r] to the current path
      of [cr].  *)

val region : Cairo.context -> Gdk.region -> unit
  (** [region cr r] adds the region [r] to the current path
      of [cr]. *)

val set_source_pixbuf : Cairo.context ->
  GdkPixbuf.pixbuf -> x:float -> y:float -> unit
  (** Sets the given pixbuf as the source pattern for the Cairo
      context.  The pattern has an extend mode of
      {!Cairo.Pattern.extend} set to [NONE] and is aligned so that the
      origin of pixbuf is ([x],[y]). *)
