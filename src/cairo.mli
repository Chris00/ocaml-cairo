        When a pattern is first created it always has the identity
        matrix for its transformation matrix, which means that pattern
        space is initially identical to user space.

        Important: Please note that the direction of this
        transformation matrix is from user space to pattern
        space. This means that if you imagine the flow from a pattern
        to user space (and on to device space), then coordinates in
        that flow will be transformed by the inverse of the pattern
        matrix.

        For example, if you want to make a pattern appear twice as
        large as it does by default the correct code to use is:
        {[
        let matrix = Cairo.Matrix.init_scale 0.5 0.5 in

      the exact bounds of the target surface.

      Note that code meant to be reusable should not call [clip_reset]
      as it will cause results unexpected by higher-level code which

      drawn as circular dots or squares respectively.  In the case of
      [SQUARE], the orientation of the squares is determined by the
      direction of the underlying path.

      2. A sub-path created by {!Cairo.move_to} followed by either a
      {!Cairo.Path.close} or one or more calls to {!Cairo.line_to} to
      the same coordinate as the {!Cairo.move_to}.  If the cap style
      is [ROUND] then these sub-paths will be drawn as circular dots.
      Note that in the case of [SQUARE] line cap, a degenerate
      sub-path will not be drawn at all, (since the correct
      orientation is indeterminate).

      (nor {!Cairo.Font_face.set} nor {!Cairo.set_scaled_font}), the
      default family is platform-specific, but is essentially
      "sans-serif".  Default slant is CAIRO_FONT_SLANT_NORMAL, and
      default weight is CAIRO_FONT_WEIGHT_NORMAL.  *)

val set_font_size : t -> float -> unit
  (** [set_font_size cr size] sets the current font matrix to a
      scale by a factor of size, replacing any font matrix previously
      set with [set_font_size] or {!Cairo.set_font_matrix}.  This
      results in a font size of size user space units.  (More precisely,
      this matrix will result in the font's em-square being a size by
      size square in user space.)

      If text is drawn without a call to [set_font_size], (nor
      {!Cairo.set_font_matrix} nor {!Cairo.Text.set_scaled_font}),
      the default font size is 10.0. *)

val set_font_matrix : t -> Matrix.t -> unit
  (** [set_font_matrix cr matrix] sets the current font matrix to
      [matrix].  The font matrix gives a transformation from the
      design space of the font (in this space, the em-square is 1
      unit by 1 unit) to user space.  Normally, a simple scale is
      used (see {!Cairo.Text.set_font_size}), but a more complex font
      matrix can be used to shear the font or stretch it unequally
      along the two axes.  *)

val get_font_matrix : t -> Matrix.t
  (** Returns the current font matrix.  See {!Cairo.set_font_matrix}. *)

val show_text : t -> string -> unit
  (** A drawing operator that generates the shape from a string of

      [font_size] (font_matrix), and [font_options].

      This function first computes a set of glyphs for the string of
      text. The first glyph is placed so that its origin is at the
      current point. The origin of each subsequent glyph is offset
      from that of the previous glyph by the advance values of the
      previous glyph.

      After this call the current point is moved to the origin of
      where the next glyph would be placed in this same progression.
      That is, the current point will be at the origin of the final
      glyph offset by its advance values. This allows for easy display
      of a single logical string with multiple calls to [show_text].  *)

val font_extents : t -> Scaled_font.font_extents
  (** Gets the font extents for the currently selected font. *)

val text_extents : t -> string -> text_extents
  (** Gets the extents for a string of text. The extents describe a
      user-space rectangle that encloses the "inked" portion of the text,
      (as it would be drawn by {!Cairo.show_text}).  Additionally, the
      [x_advance] and [y_advance] values indicate the amount by which the
      current point would be advanced by {!Cairo.show_text}.

      Note that whitespace characters do not directly contribute to
      the size of the rectangle ([extents.width] and
      [extents.height]).  They do contribute indirectly by changing
      the position of non-whitespace characters.  In particular,
      trailing whitespace characters are likely to not affect the size
      of the rectangle, though they will affect the [x_advance] and
      [y_advance] values. *)

        Raise [Error NO_CURRENT_POINT] if there is no defined current
        point.

        Most path construction functions alter the current point.  See the
        following for details on how they affect the current point:
        {!Cairo.Path.make}, {!Cairo.Path.sub}, {!Cairo.Path.append},

        {!Cairo.rectangle}, {!Cairo.text_path}, {!Cairo.glyph_path}.

        Some functions use and alter the current point but do not
        otherwise change current path: {!Cairo.show_text}.

        Some functions unset the current path and as a result, current
        point: {!Cairo.fill}, {!Cairo.stroke}. *)

  external clear : context -> unit = "caml_cairo_new_path"
    (** Clears the current path. After this call there will be no path
        and no current point. *)

  external sub : context -> unit = "caml_cairo_new_sub_path"
    (** Begin a new sub-path. Note that the existing path is not
        affected. After this call there will be no current point.

        In many cases, this call is not needed since new sub-paths are
        frequently started with {!Cairo.move_to}.

        A call to {!Cairo.Path.sub} is particularly useful when
        beginning a new sub-path with one of the {!Cairo.arc} calls.
        This makes things easier as it is no longer necessary to
        manually compute the arc's initial coordinates for a call to
        {!Cairo.move_to}. *)

  external close : context -> unit = "caml_cairo_close_path"
    (** Adds a line segment to the path from the current point to the
        beginning of the current sub-path, (the most recent point
        passed to {!Cairo.move_to}), and closes this sub-path.  After
        this call the current point will be at the joined endpoint of
        the sub-path.

        The behavior of {!Cairo.Path.close} is distinct from simply
        calling {!Cairo.line_to} with the equivalent coordinate in the
        case of stroking.  When a closed sub-path is stroked, there
        are no caps on the ends of the sub-path.  Instead, there is a
        line join connecting the final and initial segments of the
        sub-path.

        If there is no current point before the call to [close], this
        function will have no effect.

        Note: As of cairo version 1.2.4 any call to [close] will place
        an explicit [MOVE_TO] element into the path immediately after
        the [CLOSE_PATH] element, (which can be seen in
        {!Cairo.Path.copy} for example).  This can simplify path
        processing in some cases as it may not be necessary to save
        the "last move_to point" during processing as the [MOVE_TO]
        immediately after the [CLOSE_PATH] will provide that point. *)

  external glyph : context -> Glyph.t array -> unit = "caml_cairo_glyph_path"
    (** Adds closed paths for the glyphs to the current path. The
        generated path if filled, achieves an effect similar to that
        of {!Cairo.Glyph.show}. *)

  external text : context -> string -> unit = "caml_cairo_text_path"
    (** [text cr utf8] adds closed paths for text to the current path.
        The generated path if filled, achieves an effect similar to
        that of {!Cairo.show_text}.  [utf8] should be a valid UTF8
        string containing no ['\000'] characters.

        Text conversion and positioning is done similar to {!Cairo.show_text}.

        Like {!Cairo.show_text}, after this call the current point is
        moved to the origin of where the next glyph would be placed in
        this same progression.  That is, the current point will be at
        the origin of the final glyph offset by its advance values.
        This allows for chaining multiple calls to to [text] without
        having to set current point in between.

        Note: The [text] function call is part of what the cairo
        designers call the "toy" text API.  It is convenient for short
        demos and simple programs, but it is not expected to be
        adequate for serious text-using applications.  See
        {!Cairo.Glyph.path} for the "real" text path API in cairo. *)

  external extents : context -> rectangle = "caml_cairo_path_extents"
    (** Computes a bounding box in user-space coordinates covering the
        points on the current path. If the current path is empty,
        returns an empty rectangle [{ x1=0.; y1=0.; x2=0.; y2=0. }].
        Stroke parameters, fill rule, surface dimensions and clipping
        are not taken into account.

        Contrast with {!Cairo.fill_extents} and
        {!Cairo.stroke_extents} which return the extents of only the
        area that would be "inked" by the corresponding drawing
        operations.

        The result of [Cairo.Path.extents] is defined as equivalent to
        the limit of {!Cairo.stroke_extents} with [ROUND] as the line
        width approaches 0.0, (but never reaching the empty-rectangle
        returned by {!Cairo.stroke_extents} for a line width of 0.0).

        Specifically, this means that zero-area sub-paths such as
        {!Cairo.move_to}; {!Cairo.line_to} segments, (even degenerate
        cases where the coordinates to both calls are identical), will
        be considered as contributing to the extents.  However, a lone
        {!Cairo.move_to} will not contribute to the results of
        [Cairo.Path.extents]. *)

      given radius to the current path.  The arc is centered at [(xc,
      yc)], begins at [angle1] and proceeds in the direction of
      increasing angles to end at [angle2].  If [angle2] is less than
      [angle1] it will be progressively increased by 2*PI until it is
      greater than [angle1].

      If there is a current point, an initial line segment will be
      added to the path to connect the current point to the beginning
      of the arc. If this initial line is undesired, it can be avoided
      by calling {!Cairo.Path.sub} before calling [arc].

      Angles are measured in radians.  An angle of 0.0 is in the
      direction of the positive X axis (in user space). An angle of
      PI/2.0 radians (90 degrees) is in the direction of the positive
      Y axis (in user space).  Angles increase in the direction from
      the positive X axis toward the positive Y axis. So with the
      default transformation matrix, angles increase in a clockwise
      direction.

      (To convert from degrees to radians, use degrees * (PI / 180.).)

      This function gives the arc in the direction of increasing
      angles; see {!Cairo.arc_negative} to get the arc in the
      direction of decreasing angles.

      The arc is circular in user space.  To achieve an elliptical
      arc, you can scale the current transformation matrix by
      different amounts in the X and Y directions.  For example, to
      draw an ellipse in the box given by [x], [y], [width], [height]
      (we suppose [pi] holds the value of PI):
      {[
      open Cairo
