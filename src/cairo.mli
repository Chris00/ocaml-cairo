        When a pattern is first created it always has the identity
        matrix for its transformation matrix, which means that pattern
        space is initially identical to user space.

        Important: Please note that the direction of this
        transformation matrix is from user space to pattern
        space. This means that if you imagine the flow from a pattern
        to user space (and on to device space), then coordinates in
        that flow will be transformed by the inverse of the pattern
        matrix.

        For example, if you want to make a pattern appear twice as
        large as it does by default the correct code to use is:
        {[
        let matrix = Cairo.Matrix.init_scale 0.5 0.5 in

        whether the lines should be joined with a bevel instead of a
        miter.  Cairo divides the length of the miter by the line
        width.  If the result is greater than the miter limit, the

        the miter cutoff at 60 degrees, and a miter limit of 1.414

      2. A sub-path created by {!Cairo.move_to} followed by either a
      {!Cairo.close_path} or one or more calls to {!Cairo.line_to} to
      the same coordinate as the {!Cairo.move_to}.  If the cap style
      is [ROUND] then these sub-paths will be drawn as circular dots.
      Note that in the case of [SQUARE] line cap, a degenerate
      sub-path will not be drawn at all, (since the correct

        Most path construction functions alter the current point.  See the
        following for details on how they affect the current point:
        {!Cairo.Path.make}, {!Cairo.Path.sub}, {!Cairo.Path.append},
        {!Cairo.Path.close}, {!Cairo.move_to}, {!Cairo_line_to},
        {!Cairo.curve_to}, {!Cairo.rel_move_to}, {!Cairo.rel_line_to},
        {!Cairo.rel_curve_to}, {!Cairo.arc}, {!Cairo.arc_negative},
        {!Cairo.rectangle}, {!Cairo.text_path}, {!Cairo.glyph_path}.

        Some functions use and alter the current point but do not
        otherwise change current path: {!Cairo.Text.show}.

        Some functions unset the current path and as a result, current
        point: {!Cairo.fill}, {!Cairo.stroke}. *)

  external clear : t -> unit = "caml_cairo_new_path"
    (** Clears the current path. After this call there will be no path
        and no current point. *)

  external sub : t -> unit = "caml_cairo_new_sub_path"
    (** Begin a new sub-path. Note that the existing path is not
        affected. After this call there will be no current point.

        In many cases, this call is not needed since new sub-paths are
        frequently started with {!Cairo.move_to}.

        A call to {!Cairo.Path.sub} is particularly useful when
        beginning a new sub-path with one of the {!Cairo.arc} calls.
        This makes things easier as it is no longer necessary to
        manually compute the arc's initial coordinates for a call to
        {!Cairo.move_to}. *)

  external close : t -> unit = "caml_cairo_close_path"
    (** Adds a line segment to the path from the current point to the
        beginning of the current sub-path, (the most recent point
        passed to {!Cairo.move_to}), and closes this sub-path.  After
        this call the current point will be at the joined endpoint of
        the sub-path.

        The behavior of {!Cairo.Path.close} is distinct from simply
        calling {!Cairo.line_to} with the equivalent coordinate in the
        case of stroking.  When a closed sub-path is stroked, there
        are no caps on the ends of the sub-path.  Instead, there is a
        line join connecting the final and initial segments of the
        sub-path.

        If there is no current point before the call to [close], this
        function will have no effect.

        Note: As of cairo version 1.2.4 any call to [close] will place
        an explicit [MOVE_TO] element into the path immediately after
        the [CLOSE_PATH] element, (which can be seen in
        {!Cairo.Path.copy} for example).  This can simplify path
        processing in some cases as it may not be necessary to save
        the "last move_to point" during processing as the [MOVE_TO]
        immediately after the [CLOSE_PATH] will provide that point. *)

  external glyph : t -> Glyph.t array -> unit = "caml_cairo_glyph_path"
    (** Adds closed paths for the glyphs to the current path. The
        generated path if filled, achieves an effect similar to that
        of {!Cairo.Glyph.show}. *)

  external text : t -> string -> unit = "caml_cairo_text_path"
    (** [text cr utf8] adds closed paths for text to the current path.
        The generated path if filled, achieves an effect similar to
        that of {!Cairo.Text.show}.  [utf8] should be a valid UTF8
        string containing no ['\000'] characters.

        Text conversion and positioning is done similar to {!Cairo.Text.show}.

        Like {!Cairo.Text.show}, after this call the current point is
        moved to the origin of where the next glyph would be placed in
        this same progression.  That is, the current point will be at
        the origin of the final glyph offset by its advance values.
        This allows for chaining multiple calls to to [text] without
        having to set current point in between.

        Note: The [text] function call is part of what the cairo
        designers call the "toy" text API.  It is convenient for short
        demos and simple programs, but it is not expected to be
        adequate for serious text-using applications.  See
        {!Cairo.Glyph.path} for the "real" text path API in cairo. *)

  external extents : t -> rectangle = "caml_cairo_path_extents"
    (** Computes a bounding box in user-space coordinates covering the
        points on the current path. If the current path is empty,
        returns an empty rectangle [{ x1=0.; y1=0.; x2=0.; y2=0. }].
        Stroke parameters, fill rule, surface dimensions and clipping
        are not taken into account.

        Contrast with {!Cairo.fill_extents} and
        {!Cairo.stroke_extents} which return the extents of only the
        area that would be "inked" by the corresponding drawing
        operations.

        The result of [Cairo.Path.extents] is defined as equivalent to
        the limit of {!Cairo.stroke_extents} with [ROUND] as the line
        width approaches 0.0, (but never reaching the empty-rectangle
        returned by {!Cairo.stroke_extents} for a line width of 0.0).

        Specifically, this means that zero-area sub-paths such as
        {!Cairo.move_to}; {!Cairo.line_to} segments, (even degenerate
        cases where the coordinates to both calls are identical), will
        be considered as contributing to the extents.  However, a lone
        {!Cairo.move_to} will not contribute to the results of
        [Cairo.Path.extents]. *)

external arc : t ->
  x:float -> y:float -> r:float -> a1:float -> a2:float -> unit
  = "caml_cairo_arc_bc" "caml_cairo_arc"
  (** [arc xc yc radius angla1 angle2] adds a circular arc of the
      given radius to the current path.  The arc is centered at [(xc,
      yc)], begins at [angle1] and proceeds in the direction of
      increasing angles to end at [angle2].  If [angle2] is less than
      [angle1] it will be progressively increased by 2*PI until it is
      greater than [angle1].

      If there is a current point, an initial line segment will be
      added to the path to connect the current point to the beginning
      of the arc. If this initial line is undesired, it can be avoided
      by calling {!Cairo.Path.sub} before calling [arc].

      Angles are measured in radians.  An angle of 0.0 is in the
      direction of the positive X axis (in user space). An angle of
      PI/2.0 radians (90 degrees) is in the direction of the positive
      Y axis (in user space).  Angles increase in the direction from
      the positive X axis toward the positive Y axis. So with the
      default transformation matrix, angles increase in a clockwise
      direction.

      (To convert from degrees to radians, use degrees * (PI / 180.).)

      This function gives the arc in the direction of increasing
      angles; see {!Cairo.arc_negative} to get the arc in the
      direction of decreasing angles.

      The arc is circular in user space.  To achieve an elliptical
      arc, you can scale the current transformation matrix by
      different amounts in the X and Y directions.  For example, to
      draw an ellipse in the box given by [x], [y], [width], [height]
      (we suppose [pi] holds the value of PI):
      {[
      open Cairo

      save cr;
      translate cr (x +. width /. 2.) (y +. height /. 2.);
      scale cr (width /. 2.) (height /. 2.);
      arc cr 0. 0. 1. 0. (2 * pi);
      restore cr;

      decreasing angles to end at [angle2].  If [angle2] is greater
      than [angle1] it will be progressively decreased by 2*PI until
      it is less than [angle1].
